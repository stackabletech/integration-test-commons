# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2021-10-19

### Changed
- The CDN jsdelivr.net is used instead of githubusercontent.com for the Stackable repository because
  it serves the content with the content type "application/gzip" which is expected by the Stackable
  Agent ([#32]).

[#32]: https://github.com/stackabletech/integration-test-commons/pull/32

## [0.5.0] - 2021-09-22

### Added
- Generic method `list` for resources like pods or configmaps ([#27]).
- `TestClusterLabels` struct for app, instance and version labels ([#27]).
- `instance_name` to `TestClusterOptions` and implemented `new()` where a UUID is automatically appended to the `instance_name` ([#27]).

### Changed
- `kube-rs`: `0.58` → `0.60` ({25}).
- `k8s-openapi`: `version: 0.12, feature: v1_21` → `version: 0.13, feature: v1_22` ([#25]).
- `operator-rs` labels are replaced through the `TestClusterLabels` ([#27]).

### Removed
- `operator-rs` dependency ([#27]).
- `list_pods` and `list_config_maps` methods in favor for the generic `list` ([#27]).
